<h1 align="center"> DEEP LEARNING </h1>

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------  -->
[Deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods, which is based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. The adjective "deep" in deep learning refers to the use of multiple layers in the network. Methods used can be either supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.
