# Python Tips

* To accept multiple inputs as list in one line

        input_var_name,  input_var_name = list(map(int,input().split()))

* To print in a more readable way (f-strings)

        print(f"write something")

* To open files and close it without writing file.close() explicitly

        with open("<FileName>", '<mode>') as <variable_name>:

* To print some digits after decimal point

        print(round(<var_name>, <no_of_digits_after_dp>))

* To return more than one value from a function

        return <value1>, <value2>



# Python PIP Tips

* To install packages

        pip install <package_name>

* To uninstall packages

        pip uninstall <package_name>

* To update/upgrade packages

        pip install --upgrade <package_name> 
        OR
        pip install -U <package_name>

* To see list of installed python packages

        pip list

* To see outdated packages in your system

        pip list -o
