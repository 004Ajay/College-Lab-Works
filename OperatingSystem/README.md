<h1 align="center"> OPERATING SYSTEM & SHELL PROGRAMMING </h1>

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------  -->

An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.

The shell is the layer of programming that understands and executes the commands a user enters
